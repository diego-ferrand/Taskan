# Taskan
Very simple open source tool that will display current activity. It will store metrics such as time in current task, recommend breaks and keep logs of all previous activity in day/week/month. You can set a backlog of tasks with daily reminders to groom the tasks. The tool will also provide suggestions to facilitate future tasks estimations (For example, if a task is taking more than a day you will be suggested to divide into subtasks in future instances) among other features.  

It is completely offline, any data added to it and history of your activities will be stored on your machine.

### Features
- CRUD tasks
- Next/Jump to task
- Task states (PENDING, INPROGRESS, CONTINGENT/REPEAT, COMPLETED).   Contingent tasks can have a recall rate. So it can remind you daily to follow up.
- Import tasks from a external tool such as jira (Can be extended by user, should be like protocol handler for Taurus)
- Priorities and estimations per task
